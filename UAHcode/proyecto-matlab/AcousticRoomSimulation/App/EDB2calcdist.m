function distances = EDB2calcdist(x1,x2)
% EDB2calcdist - Gives distances between sets of points in 3D space.
% EDB2calcdist returns a matrix of distances from all n1 points
% in x1 to all n2 points in x2.
%
% Input parameters:
%   x1      Matrix, [n1,3], with the coordinates of n1 points.
%   x2      Matrix, [n2,3], with the coordinates of n2 points.
%
% Output parameters:
%   distances   Matrix, [n1,n2], with the distances from all
%               points in x1 to all points in x2.
%
% Uses no special functions.
